          <p className="description">I am a former STEM teacher and an NYC Teach for America alum with previous remote work experience at a Y Combinator startup based in Silicon Valley (Employee #1, YC W19) who is now interested in building and innovating on dynamic projects. A couple of random facts about me: I have interned at the US State Department/US Embassy in Paris, a neuroscience laboratory at Georgetown University, have shadowed an Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at Weill Cornell/NY Presbyterian Hospital, and have worked as a barista in an NYC coffeehouse. I was in an alternative rock band in college who played at the university's local coffee shop. I have lived in Paris, NYC, Charlottesville, Virginia, and metropolitan Washington, DC.</p>
